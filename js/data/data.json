    "description":"The Mulhausen Report [document00.023.603] details the discovery of SCP-002, describing it as a large, fleshy growth resembling a tumor. The object has a volume of approximately 60 cubic meters (or 2000 cubic feet) and features an iron valve hatch leading to its interior. Inside, there's a room resembling a standard low-rent apartment, complete with furniture made from biological substances like bone and hair, each with its own unique DNA sequence. Notably, the room has a window that is only visible from the inside. The report likely provides further insights into the circumstances surrounding SCP-002's discovery and initial containment.",
    "containmentinfo": "SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times, to keep it in what appears to be a recharging mode. In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times.\n\nTeams including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel should maintain physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or influenced by proximity to the object.\n\nNo personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002. This requirement may be waived via written authorization from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators. Command staff issued such a waiver must be escorted by at least five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of their contact and must temporarily surrender their rank and security clearance. Following contact, command staff will be escorted at least 5 km from SCP-002 to undergo a seventy-two (72)-hour quarantine and psychological evaluation. If deemed fit for return to duty by psych staff, rank and security clearance may be restored when quarantine expires."

    "description":"SCP-003 comprises SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2, two enigmatic components. SCP-003-1 resembles a sentient motherboard, while SCP-003-2 is a rune-covered stone tablet housing a mysterious internal computer. Exposure to temperatures below 35°C triggers reactions in both components. SCP-003-1 exhibits exponential growth, fueled by surrounding matter, while SCP-003-2 emits radiation to control it. Despite extensive study, their origins and connections to other SCP objects remain elusive.",
    "containmentinfo": "SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C and ideally kept above 100°C. No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact with SCP-003.\n\nIn event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its second growth stage.\n\nPersonnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report for sterilization afterwards.\n\nSCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of emergency procedures detailed above. Any significant change in SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color) should be reported within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at all times."

    "description": "SCP-004 consists of SCP-004-1, an old barn door, and SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, rusted keys. Opening SCP-004-1 with the keys leads to deadly outcomes, including disappearance or dismemberment of individuals. Temporal and spatial anomalies are associated with SCP-004, with instances of missing individuals reappearing and SCP-004-7 opening into an alternate dimension. Ongoing research explores SCP-004's effects and the potential of the keys to open other anomalous doors. SCP-004-14, a wooden box, can make items vanish irretrievably when closed and locked.",
    "containmentinfo": "When handling items SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, proper procedure is vital. The items are not permitted to be moved off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 security personnel...\n\nLevel 1 clearance is required for basic access to SCP-004-1; Level 4 clearance is required for use of SCP-004-2 to -13."

    "description":"SCP-005 is an ornate key resembling those from the 1920s. It possesses the unique ability to unlock any lock, whether mechanical or digital, with ease. However, attempts to disguise locks have shown some success in defeating its ability, suggesting a level of sentience. Use of SCP-005 as a security pass replacement requires Level 4 supervision and is prohibited for personal use or vending machine repairs. Removal from the compound results in immediate termination. Ongoing tests aim to understand its cognitive abilities.",
    "containmentinfo":"SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area."

    "objectclass":"Safe",
    "description":"SCP-006 is a small spring located west of Astrakhan, known since the 19th century but secured by the Foundation in 1991 due to political obstacles. Disguised as a chemical factory, the spring emits mineral water with remarkable healing properties. Ingestion enhances human DNA regeneration, tissue repair, and immune system effectiveness. Animal testing showed immediate destruction of hostile bacteria and viruses, with higher primates experiencing similar benefits to humans.",
    "containmentinfo": "Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The following procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who interact with it.\n\nAll personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.\nProcedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.\nAny procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. The liquid is to be transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.\nIf at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)"
